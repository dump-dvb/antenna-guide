This folder contains all the 3D files to build a dipole antenna.

TODO: add picture of the antenna

The antenna is constructed for a PL239 (?) connector, 20mm pvc pipeing, brass rods and a few 3d printed parts.

`center_part.slvs` is the Solvespace file for center part connecting of the antenna holding everything together.

`end_cap.slvs` is the Solvespace file for end caps of the 20mm pipeing. Alternatively the antenna can be capped of with an anemometer and disgused as a weather station.

STL files for the anemometer can be found [here](TODO).
They have to be scaled down by TODO% and a custom cap (TODO: add link to file) has to be used.
