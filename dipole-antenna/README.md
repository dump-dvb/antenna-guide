TODO: add picture of the antenna

## Parts
The antenna is constructed using following parts:

| Part name             | Count | Note                                                                                         | Link |
|---|---|---|---|
| SO239 socket          | 1x    |                                                                                              | [https://www.ebay.de/itm/294407664610](https://www.ebay.de/itm/294407664610) |
| M20 pvc pipe          | 1x    | widend part at one end fits perfectly over the PL259 to BNC adapter                          | [https://www.hornbach.de/shop/Installationsrohr-starr-M20-grau-2-0-m/10367394/artikel.html](https://www.hornbach.de/shop/Installationsrohr-starr-M20-grau-2-0-m/10367394/artikel.html) |
| PL259 to BNC adapter  | 1x    |                                                                                              | [https://www.ebay.de/itm/384868148089](https://www.ebay.de/itm/384868148089) |
| 50Î© BNC cable         | 1x    |                                                                                              |      |
| hollow brass rods     | 1x    | any solderable hollow rod would work, this one is 5mm OD. 3D files may need adjustment       | [https://www.hornbach.de/shop/Messing-Rundrohr-aussen-5-0-mm-innen-4-1-mm-Laenge-1000-mm/6178978/artikel.html](https://www.hornbach.de/shop/Messing-Rundrohr-aussen-5-0-mm-innen-4-1-mm-Laenge-1000-mm/6178978/artikel.html) |
| `center_part.slvs`    | 1x    | 3d printed part, adjust hole size for your metal rods                                        |      |
| `end_cap.slvs`        | 2x    | 3d printed part                                                                              |      |

`center_part.slvs` is the Solvespace file for center part connecting of the antenna holding everything together.

`end_cap.slvs` is the Solvespace file for end caps of the 20mm pipeing. Alternatively the antenna can be capped of with an anemometer and disgused as a weather station.

STL files for the anemometer can be found [here](TODO).
They have to be scaled down by TODO% and a custom cap (TODO: add link to file) has to be used.
